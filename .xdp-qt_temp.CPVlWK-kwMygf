# CSCC85 Project 0: Catapult

https://youtube.com/shorts/qaNhdpgrmq8?si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE

Code for a chocolate-launching catapult using Lego EV3 and C. Unfortunately did not take any proper photos of the finished product or range, so this development update above will have to do. The design uses 3 motors: one for pulling the arm back, one for engaging/disengaging the arms with the motor, and one that just changes the angle the catapult is facing (to aim).

## Controls

I decided to use a 3 axis control scheme for the three motors, with key pairs being WS, AD, and QE, each corresponding to a different motor.
